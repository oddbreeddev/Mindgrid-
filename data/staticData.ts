    content: "## Introduction\nSuccess in the POST-UTME is the final hurdle for thousands of Nigerian students. While JAMB tests general knowledge, POST-UTME often tests your depth in specific core subjects relevant to your course of choice.\n\n### 1. Research Specific University Patterns\nEvery university has a unique style. For example, UNILAG might focus on Mathematics and General Knowledge, while OAU tends to be more subject-specific. Obtain 'Original' past questions for your specific school.\n\n### 2. Time Management is Key\nMost POST-UTME exams are computer-based (CBT) and give you very little time. Practice answering 40 questions in 25 minutes to build speed.",

Using these instead of a mouse can save you up to 10 minutes.",
